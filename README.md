Object Categorization Based Emotion Recognition with User  Demographics via Image Emotion Analysis

Emotions are a fundamental part of human behavior, which plays an important role in effective communication. They can be triggered or recognized by different means including human facial expressions, speech and audio, text, and other audio-visual contents. With the increasing use of social media platforms, image-based emotion analysis has become a key research area in affective computing. This research study also focuses on inferring user emotions from object images, where objects correspond to real-life objects which human beings encounter in their routine life. The proposed idea is to infer emotion tags from object images based on the user perception of emotions while interacting with these objects in real life. We validated the proposed scheme on Caltech101 and state-of-the-art Caltech_256 dataset considering five basic emotion categories. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.
